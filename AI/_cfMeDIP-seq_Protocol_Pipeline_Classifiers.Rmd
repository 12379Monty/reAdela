#  Initial cfMeDIP-seq Protocol (Nature Protocols 2019)

## Overview

The cfMeDIP-seq protocol was published by Shen, Burgener, Bratman, and De Carvalho in Nature Protocols (2019) as an adaptation of conventional MeDIP-seq for low-input cell-free DNA samples. The protocol enables methylome profiling from 1-10 ng of input DNA through the addition of "filler DNA" before immunoprecipitation.

**Timeline**: The protocol can be completed in approximately 3-4 days by a standard molecular biology laboratory.

**Key Innovation**: Addition of filler DNA (unmethylated lambda phage DNA or methylated genomic DNA) acts as a carrier to improve the efficiency and specificity of antibody-mediated capture of methylated cfDNA fragments.

## Protocol Steps {#prot-steps}

The cfMeDIP-seq protocol consists of four major stages.  See Section \@ref(prot-flowchart)
for a visual representation.

### **STAGE 1: Library Preparation from cfDNA (Day 1)**

**Step 1: cfDNA End-Repair and A-Tailing**

- Input: 1-10 ng of plasma cfDNA
- Process: Repair DNA ends to create blunt ends with 5' phosphates
- Add adenosine (A) overhangs to 3' ends to enable adapter ligation
- Time: ~2-3 hours
- **Variability Sources**: 
  - DNA input quantity affects downstream efficiency
  - Temperature control during enzymatic reactions
  - Timing of enzymatic reactions

**Step 2: Adapter Ligation**

- Ligate methylated sequencing adapters to DNA fragments
- Adapters contain unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in some implementations
- Time: ~2-3 hours
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Adapter concentration and quality
  - Ligation efficiency (temperature, enzyme activity)
  - Adapter dimer formation

**Step 3: Purification**

- Remove excess adapters and reaction components
- Use SPRI beads (Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization)
- Time: ~1 hour
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Bead-to-DNA ratio affects recovery
  - Washing steps may cause sample loss
  - Ethanol quality and evaporation timing

### **STAGE 2: Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (Day 2)**

**Step 4: Addition of Filler DNA and Spike-In Controls**

- Add filler DNA to reach total DNA amount of ~1 μg
- Filler DNA options:
  - Lambda phage DNA (unmethylated)
  - Human genomic DNA (methylated)
- Add Arabidopsis thaliana spike-in controls (methylated and unmethylated)
- Or add synthetic spike-in controls (Wilson et al., 2022)
- Time: ~30 minutes
- **Variability Sources** (<span style="color:red">HIGH IMPACT</span>):
  - **Type of filler DNA** (methylated vs unmethylated) significantly affects results
  - Filler DNA quality and methylation status
  - Spike-in control quantity and integrity
  - This is a major source of batch effects between labs

**Step 5: DNA Denaturation**

- Heat DNA to 95°C for 10 minutes to denature double-stranded DNA
- Immediately place on ice
- Time: ~15 minutes
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Temperature accuracy
  - Denaturation time consistency
  - Cooling rate

**Step 6: Immunoprecipitation**

- Incubate denatured DNA with anti-5-methylcytosine (5mC) antibody
- Typically use 5 μg of antibody per reaction
- Incubate overnight at 4°C with rotation
- Antibody binds to methylated DNA fragments
- Time: ~16-18 hours (overnight)
- **Variability Sources** (<span style="color:red">HIGH IMPACT</span>):
  - **Antibody lot-to-lot variation** (different antibody lots show different binding efficiencies)
  - Antibody concentration
  - Incubation time and temperature
  - Rotation speed/mixing efficiency
  - DNA concentration affects antibody binding

**Step 7: Capture with Protein A/G Beads**

- Add Protein A/G magnetic beads to capture antibody-DNA complexes
- Incubate for 2 hours at 4°C with rotation
- Time: ~2 hours
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Bead quality and binding capacity
  - Incubation time
  - Non-specific binding to beads

**Step 8: Washing**

- Wash beads 3-5 times with immunoprecipitation buffer
- Remove non-specifically bound DNA
- Critical step for specificity
- Time: ~30 minutes
- **Variability Sources** (MODERATE IMPACT):
  - Number and vigor of washes
  - Buffer composition and pH
  - Temperature during washing
  - Magnetic separation efficiency

**Step 9: Elution**

- Elute DNA from beads using proteinase K digestion
- Incubate at 50°C for 2-3 hours
- Time: ~3 hours
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Proteinase K activity
  - Elution efficiency
  - Temperature and timing

**Step 10: Purification of Immunoprecipitated DNA**

- Purify eluted DNA using SPRI beads
- Time: ~1 hour
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Recovery efficiency
  - Contamination with residual proteins

### **STAGE 3: Library Amplification (Day 3)**

**Step 11: qPCR Quality Control**

- Perform qPCR on a small aliquot to assess:
  - Enrichment of methylated regions (positive control: HIST1H2BA)
  - Depletion of unmethylated regions (negative control: GAPDH)
  - Fold-enrichment ratio should be >25
- Calculate specificity using spike-in controls
- Specificity should be >95% (i.e., <5% of unmethylated DNA captured)
- Time: ~2 hours
- **Variability Sources**:
  - qPCR technical variability
  - Primer efficiency
  - Quality thresholds affect decision to proceed

**Step 12: PCR Amplification**

- Amplify library using indexed primers
- Typically 12-15 cycles of PCR
- Use high-fidelity polymerase
- Time: ~2 hours
- **Variability Sources** (MODERATE IMPACT):
  - **PCR cycle number** affects library complexity and duplication rate
  - PCR bias (GC-content, fragment length)
  - Primer concentration
  - Polymerase fidelity and processivity

**Step 13: Final Purification and Size Selection**

- Purify PCR products with SPRI beads
- Perform size selection (typically 200-600 bp)
- Time: ~1 hour
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Size selection stringency
  - Recovery efficiency

**Step 14: Library Quantification and Quality Assessment**

- Quantify library concentration using Qubit or qPCR
- Assess library size distribution using Bioanalyzer or TapeStation
- Check for adapter dimers
- Time: ~1 hour
- **Variability Sources**:
  - Quantification method accuracy
  - Fragment size distribution affects sequencing

### **STAGE 4: High-Throughput Sequencing (Day 4 and beyond)**

**Step 15: Sequencing**

- Pool libraries with unique barcodes
- Perform paired-end sequencing (typically 2 × 75 bp or 2 × 150 bp)
- Platform: Illumina (HiSeq, NovaSeq, or NextSeq)
- Target depth: 5-20 million paired-end reads per sample
- **Variability Sources** (MODERATE IMPACT):
  - **Sequencing depth** significantly affects detection sensitivity
  - Sequencing quality (Q-scores)
  - Base-calling errors
  - Cluster density on flow cell

## Quality Control Metrics

The protocol includes several QC checkpoints:

1. **Fold-Enrichment Ratio**: Ratio of methylated (HIST1H2BA) to unmethylated (GAPDH) regions
   - Threshold: >25-fold enrichment
   - Measures immunoprecipitation specificity

2. **Specificity**: Percentage of reads mapping to methylated spike-in controls vs unmethylated
   - Threshold: >95% specificity
   - Calculated using Arabidopsis thaliana spike-ins

3. **CpG Enrichment**: Relative frequency of CpGs in enriched regions vs genome
   - Indicates successful capture of methylated regions

4. **Saturation Analysis**: Assesses whether sequencing depth is adequate
   - Uses MEDIPS package
   - Determines if additional sequencing would provide more information

5. **Fragment Size Distribution**: Should match cfDNA size profile
   - Peak at ~166 bp (mononucleosomal)
   - Range: 100-700 bp

## Key Sources of Variability

Based on the protocol and subsequent validation studies, the major sources of variability are:

### **Consistent (Systematic) Variability Sources:**

1. **Type of Filler DNA** (<span style="color:red">HIGH IMPACT</span>)
   - Methylated vs unmethylated filler creates systematic differences
   - Wilson et al. (2022) showed this accounts for ~5% of variance
   - Can be corrected with spike-in controls

2. **Antibody Lot** (<span style="color:red">HIGH IMPACT</span>)
   - Different antibody lots have different binding characteristics
   - Affects enrichment efficiency consistently across a batch
   - Difficult to correct without spike-in standards

3. **Sequencing Depth** (MODERATE-HIGH IMPACT</span>)
   - Lower depth reduces sensitivity for rare methylation events
   - Affects detection of low tumor fraction samples
   - Predictable effect that can be modeled

4. **PCR Cycle Number** (MODERATE IMPACT)
   - More cycles increase duplication rate
   - Introduces GC-content and length biases
   - Systematic across samples in same batch

5. **Fragment Length, GC Content, and CpG Density** (MODERATE IMPACT)
   - Biophysical properties affect antibody binding
   - Longer fragments, higher GC, and higher CpG density are preferentially captured
   - Can be modeled and corrected with appropriate normalization

### **Sporadic (Random) Variability Sources:**

1. **DNA Input Quality and Quantity** (<span style="color:red">HIGH IMPACT</span>)
   - Degraded DNA reduces library quality
   - Very low input (<1 ng) increases stochasticity
   - Patient-to-patient variation in cfDNA characteristics

2. **Temperature Fluctuations** (LOW-MODERATE IMPACT)
   - During overnight incubation
   - During enzymatic reactions
   - Causes run-to-run variation

3. **Bead Handling** (LOW-MODERATE IMPACT)
   - Incomplete resuspension
   - Magnetic separation timing
   - Sample loss during transfers

4. **Operator Technique** (LOW-MODERATE IMPACT)
   - Pipetting accuracy and precision
   - Timing of steps
   - Contamination

5. **Sequencing Quality** (LOW-MODERATE IMPACT)
   - Flow cell quality variation
   - Cluster density effects
   - Lane effects on Illumina platforms

## Improvements to Mitigate Variability

**Synthetic Spike-In Controls (Wilson et al., 2022)**

A major improvement to the protocol was the development of synthetic spike-in controls with defined characteristics:

- 54 DNA fragments with combinations of:
  - Methylation status (methylated and unmethylated)
  - Fragment length (80, 160, 320 bp)
  - GC content (35%, 50%, 65%)
  - CpG fraction (1/80 bp, 1/40 bp, 1/20 bp)
- Addition of 0.01 ng spike-in controls enables:
  - Absolute quantification of methylated cfDNA
  - Batch effect correction
  - Correction for fragment length, GC, and CpG biases
  - Quality control per sample

**Benefits Demonstrated:**

- Mitigates batch effects between laboratories
- Corrects for filler DNA type (methylated vs unmethylated)
- Provides absolute quantification standard
- Enables robust inter-batch comparisons

**Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) (Burgener et al., 2021)**


Addition of UMIs to sequencing adapters enables:
- Removal of PCR duplicates while preserving biological duplicates
- Correction for sequence errors
- Improved quantification accuracy
- Essential for MRD applications with very low tumor fractions

- Limitation: May not capture cancer-relevant variation

**3. Iterative Supervised PCA (ISPCA)**

- Supervised variant of PCA
- Iteratively selects features most associated with outcome
- Performs PCA on selected features
- Combines feature selection with dimensionality reduction
- **Finding: Most robust feature generation method**

**ISPCA Algorithm:**

```
1. Initialize: Select features by univariate test
2. Iteration:
   a. Perform PCA on selected features
   b. Extract top K principal components
   c. Fit classifier using PCs
   d. Rank features by association with outcome
   e. Update selected features
3. Converge when feature set stabilizes
```

### **Classification Methods Evaluated**

**1. GLMnet (Elastic Net)**

- Same as Shen et al. 2018
- Best with raw features
- Automatic feature selection

**2. Logistic Regression with L1 Penalty (Lasso)**

- Simpler than GLMnet (α = 1)

- Regions defined by Fisher's exact test
- Surprisingly effective
- **Finding: Simple and robust**

### **Key Findings from Systematic Comparison**

**Best Overall Methods:**

1. **Fisher's Exact Test + ISPCA + Logistic Regression**: Most robust across datasets
2. **Simple Logistic Regression** (2 features): Nearly as good, much simpler
3. **GLMnet**: Good performance but more variable

**Effect of Sequencing Depth:**

- All methods degrade with lower depth
- Fisher's exact test most robust to low depth
- ISPCA maintains performance better than PCA
- Depth < 5M reads significantly impacts sensitivity

**Effect of Tumor Fraction:**

- Critical factor for all methods
- <1% tumor fraction: All methods struggle
- 1-5% tumor fraction: Best methods achieve 70-90% sensitivity
- >5% tumor fraction: >95% sensitivity achievable

**Recommendations:**

- Use Fisher's exact test for feature selection
- Consider ISPCA for dimensionality reduction

# Physical Sample Format Through the Protocol

Understanding how samples are physically arranged and grouped through the workflow is important for identifying potential sources of batch effects and ensuring proper randomization.

## Sample Format Transitions

```
STAGE 1: Library Preparation
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 1-2: End-repair, A-tailing, Adapter Ligation
  Format: PCR strip tubes (8-well) or 96-well plates
  Typical batch: 8-48 samples per run
  Equipment: Thermal cycler
  
Step 3: SPRI Bead Purification
  Format: Same plate/strips on magnetic rack
  ⚠️ Edge wells may have evaporation effects

STAGE 2: Immunoprecipitation  
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 4: Add Filler DNA & Spike-ins
  Format: Same plate/strips OR transfer to 1.5 mL tubes
  Master mix preparation critical for consistency
  
Step 5: Denaturation (95°C)
  Format: PCR strips/plates in thermal cycler
  Rapid transfer to ice required
  
Step 6: Anti-5mC Immunoprecipitation (Overnight)
  Format: Often 1.5 mL low-bind tubes (for rotation)
         OR deep-well plates on rotator
  Typical batch: 12-24 samples per rotation device
  ⚠️ Rotation position may affect mixing efficiency
  ⚠️ Samples processed on different days = different batches
  
Step 7-8: Bead Capture, Washing, Elution
  Format: Same tubes/plates on magnetic rack
  Sequential processing introduces time variation

STAGE 3: Amplification
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Step 9: qPCR Quality Control
  Format: 96-well or 384-well qPCR plates
  Subset of samples tested (not all)
  Decision point: Pass/fail before continuing
  
Step 10: PCR Amplification
  Format: 96-well plates in thermal cycler
  ⚠️ Different thermal cyclers = potential batch effect
  ⚠️ Plate position effects (edge vs center)
  
Step 11: Final Purification & Size Selection
  Format: 96-well plates (bead-based)
         OR individual gel lanes (gel-based)

Library QC:
  Format: Bioanalyzer chips (11 samples/chip)
         OR TapeStation (16 samples/strip)
         OR Fragment Analyzer (96-well)
  ⚠️ Samples on different chips = slight variation in sizing

STAGE 4: Sequencing
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pooling:
  Format: Individual libraries → single pooled tube
  Equimolar pooling based on QC concentrations
  Typical pool: 12-48 samples (depending on target depth)
  
Sequencing:
  Format: Flow cell lanes
  ⚠️ Different lanes = lane effects
  ⚠️ Different flow cells = batch effects
  ⚠️ Different sequencing runs = major batch boundary
```

## Typical Batch Structure

**Small Study (24-48 samples):**

```
Blood collection (individual tubes)
    ↓
Plasma isolation (individual tubes, same day)
    ↓
cfDNA extraction (individual elution tubes)
    ↓
Library prep (2× 24-well plates OR 1× 48-well plate)
    ↓
IP overnight (2× rotation devices, 12-24 tubes each)
    ↓
PCR amplification (1× 96-well plate, half-filled)
    ↓
Pooling (1-2 pools)
    ↓
Sequencing (1-2 lanes on single flow cell)
```

**Large Study (200+ samples):**

```
Blood collection (individual tubes, multiple collection sites/days)
    ↓
Plasma isolation (batched by collection date)
    ↓
cfDNA extraction (batched, 24-48 per extraction day)
    ↓
Library prep (multiple 96-well plates, different days)
    ↓
IP overnight (multiple rotation batches)
    ↓
PCR amplification (multiple plates, potentially different cyclers)
    ↓
Pooling (multiple pools, 24-48 samples each)
    ↓
Sequencing (multiple flow cells, different runs)
```

## Randomization Recommendations

To minimize confounding of biological variables with batch effects:

1. **Plate Layout**: Randomize case/control status across plate positions
2. **Avoid Edge Wells**: Or include edge position as covariate^[
edge effects are typically sporadic and not amenable to such simple correction.]
3. **Balance Batches**: Equal numbers of cases/controls per IP batch
4. **Sequence Together**: Pool cases and controls on same flow cell
5. **Track Everything**: Record plate position, batch date, operator, equipment IDs
6. **Include Technical Replicates**: Same sample across batches to assess batch effects
7. **Use Spike-in Controls**: Enable computational batch correction

## Critical Batch Boundaries

| Transition | Batch Effect Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Different collection days | High | Include collection date as covariate |
| Different cfDNA extraction batches | Moderate | Standardize protocol, randomize |
| Different IP overnight batches | High | Randomize, include batch covariate |
| Different thermal cyclers | Moderate | Use single cycler if possible |
| Different antibody lots | Very High | Use single lot, or include as covariate |
| Different sequencing runs | High | Balance groups, use spike-ins |
| Different operators | Moderate | Standardize training, track operator |

- Inflammation increases cfDNA levels
- Exercise effects on cfDNA
- Circadian variation in cfDNA levels
- Medication effects

**Hemolysis**:

- Visual hemolysis grading
- Hemolysis index measurement
- Impact on methylation profiles (genomic DNA contamination)

### Cost Breakdown and Sequencing Depth Trade-offs

**Per-Sample Cost Components** (approximate, 2024):

- cfDNA extraction: $15-30
- Library preparation reagents: $30-50
- Antibody (per reaction): $10-20
- Spike-in controls: $5-10
- Sequencing (at 10M reads): $50-100
- Total per sample: ~$110-210

**Sequencing Depth Considerations**:
| Depth (reads) | Cost | Sensitivity | Use Case |
|---------------|------|-------------|----------|
| 5M | Low | Moderate | Screening, high tumor fraction |
| 10M | Medium | Good | Standard detection |
| 20M | High | Excellent | Early stage, low tumor fraction |
| 50M+ | Very High | Maximum | MRD, ultra-sensitive |

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:

- Pooling more samples per lane (lower depth, lower cost)
- Targeted approaches for specific regions (not genome-wide)
- Two-stage testing (screen with low depth, confirm with high depth)

	### MBD-seq Comparison

**Methyl-Binding Domain Sequencing (MBD-seq)**:

- Alternative enrichment approach using MBD proteins instead of antibodies
- MBD2 protein commonly used
- Higher affinity for densely methylated regions

**Comparison with cfMeDIP-seq**:

| Feature | cfMeDIP-seq | MBD-seq |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Enrichment agent | Anti-5mC antibody | MBD2 protein |
| CpG density preference | Moderate | Strong (prefers dense) |
| Low-input capability | Excellent (1-10 ng) | Moderate (10-100 ng) |
| CpG-poor region coverage | Better | Limited |
| Cost | Moderate | Similar |
| Antibody lot variation | Yes (problematic) | No (recombinant protein) |
| Reproducibility | Good with controls | Generally good |

**When to Consider MBD-seq**:

- When antibody lot variation is problematic
- When focusing on CpG-dense regions (islands, promoters)
- When higher input DNA is available

**Recent Developments**:

- MBD-seq with ultra-low input protocols emerging
- Hybrid approaches combining both methods
- Commercial kits available (e.g., MethylMiner)
